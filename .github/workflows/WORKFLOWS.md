# CI/CD Workflows

## Overview

The workflows are organized into two categories:

- **Top-level workflows** — triggered by events (push, PR, tag, manual dispatch)
- **Reusable workflows** — prefixed with `_`, called by top-level workflows via `workflow_call`

## Top-Level Workflows

### `ci.yml` — Continuous Integration

**Triggers:** push to `main`, pull requests to `main`, manual dispatch

Runs the full test suite across the monorepo. Cancels in-progress runs for PRs.

| Job | Depends On | What it does |
|-----|-----------|--------------|
| `changes` | — | Detects changed paths (engine/crates/Cargo) for scoping downstream jobs |
| `engine-build` | — | Builds debug `iii` with all features, uploads `iii-binary` artifact (critical path) |
| `engine-test` | — | Tests `iii-worker`, `iii-filesystem`, `iii-network`, `iii-init`, and `iii --all-features` |
| `engine-coverage` | `changes` | `cargo llvm-cov` on `iii --all-features`. PRs: only when engine paths change. Push/dispatch: always |
| `engine-benches` | — | `cargo bench --benches --no-run` to verify benches compile |
| `engine-fmt` | — | `cargo fmt --all -- --check` |
| `engine-build-matrix` | — | Cross-platform build validation (macOS, Windows, Linux, musl) |
| `sdk-node-ci` | `engine-build` | Type check, build, start engine, run SDK tests |
| `sdk-python-ci` | `engine-build` | Lint (ruff), type check (mypy), start engine, run pytest. Matrix: Python 3.10/3.11/3.12 |
| `sdk-rust-ci` | `engine-build` | Fmt, clippy, start engine, run cargo tests |
| `sdk-go-ci` | `engine-build` | gofmt, vet, race unit tests, start engine, run `-tags integration` tests |
| `console-ci` | — | Lint + build frontend (Node 22), build console Rust binary |

All SDK tests download the engine binary artifact and start a live engine instance before running.

### `create-tag.yml` — Version Bump & Tag Creation

**Triggers:** manual dispatch only

Entry point for all releases. Provides a form with:

| Input | Options |
|-------|---------|
| `target` | `iii` |
| `bump` | `patch`, `minor`, `major` |
| `prerelease` | `none`, `alpha`, `beta`, `rc`, `next` |
| `dry_run` | boolean |

**What it does:**

1. Validates it's running on `main` and all required manifest files exist
2. Reads the current version from the canonical manifest
3. Calculates the next version (handles semver bump + prerelease labels + dry-run suffixes)
4. **Stable releases only** — validates docs are ready (`pin_docs.py validate`): `docs/docs.json` must have a `Next` block and the `docs/next/` folder must be non-empty (stable releases pull their docs from `docs/next/`). If not, the workflow posts a Slack alert and aborts **before** bumping or tagging. Runs even on dry runs.
5. Converts to PEP 440 format for Python packages (e.g., `1.0.0-alpha.1` becomes `1.0.0a1`)
6. Updates all manifest files in lockstep (Cargo.toml, package.json, pyproject.toml)
7. Updates docs from `docs/next/` on stable releases (`pin_docs.py rotate`, which dispatches on the version):
   - **minor/major** — rotates: archives the old Latest into `docs/OLD-MINOR-0/` (its `Latest` block becomes archived), promotes `docs/next/` into the root as a new `Latest` block labeled with the **tag version** (the official version comes from the tag and can be anything), relabels the `Next` block to `MINOR + 1` (reusing the `docs/next/` folder), and reorders the dropdown (Next, Latest, archived newest-first — Mintlify's own ordering does not work).
   - **patch** — syncs in place: replaces the root content with `docs/next/`. No archive, no `Next` bump, no version-block changes — it just refreshes the current Latest's docs.
   - **all prereleases** (`alpha`/`beta`/`rc`/`next`) leave docs untouched.
   - In-content links are version-relative, so files move verbatim; only `docs.json` nav paths carry the version prefix.
8. Commits the version bump (including any docs changes), creates an annotated tag, and pushes both
9. Posts a Slack notification

> **Docs layout:** `Latest` lives at the docs root (unprefixed paths); `Next` lives in the fixed `docs/next/` folder; archived versions live in `docs/MAJOR-MINOR-0/` folders. `docs/changelog/` is shared by all versions — it stays at the root, is never copied into a version folder, and every version's Changelog tab points at it. Rotation assumes this shape already exists (a `Latest` root block + a `Next` block pointing at `docs/next/`).

The tag push then triggers the corresponding release workflow.

**Tag format:** `{target}/v{version}` (e.g., `iii/v1.2.3`)

---

### `alpha-release.yml` — Isolated Per-Branch Alpha

**Triggers:** manual dispatch only — run from a feature branch via "Use workflow from: `<branch>`"

Publishes an alpha prerelease of every SDK (npm, pypi, crates, go), the engine binaries, and the builtin workers **from any feature branch, without touching `main`**. Built for testing a branch end-to-end before merging.

| Input | Options |
|-------|---------|
| `dry_run` | boolean (build + validate, no upload; still pushes the alpha tag) |

**What it does:**

1. Refuses to run on `main` (use `create-tag.yml` for official releases)
2. Calculates the version with `calculate_release_version.py --bump none --counter-tag-prefix iii-alpha`: anchors on the latest stable `iii/v*` tag and appends an accumulating `-alpha.N` suffix (`0.19.2-alpha.1`, `.2`, `.3` …). The official version is never advanced.
3. Bumps all manifests in lockstep (Cargo.toml, package.json, pyproject.toml, **Go `sdkVersion` const**) into an **ephemeral commit**
4. Pushes **only** the `iii-alpha/v{version}` tag — never a branch, never `main`
5. Publishes, all checking out that tag:
   - **SDK packages** — `_npm.yml` (single `pnpm -r publish` job), `_py.yml`, `_rust-cargo.yml`, `_go.yml`
   - **Engine binaries** — `iii`, `iii-worker`, `iii-init` via `_rust-binary.yml`, attached to a GitHub **prerelease** on the `iii-alpha/v*` tag
   - **Builtin workers + skills** — `_publish-engine-workers.yml` / `_publish-worker-skills.yml` published to the workers registry under a dedicated **`alpha`** tag (never `next`/`latest`)

**Isolation:** the `iii-alpha/v*` namespace does not match `release-iii.yml`'s `iii/v*` trigger, so the official pipeline never fires. Engine binaries land on a separate prerelease (own tag namespace); workers use the dedicated `alpha` registry tag — neither collides with the official `iii/v*` releases or the `next`/`latest` channels. **Console, docker and homebrew are intentionally excluded.**

**Engine install:** because the binaries live under `iii-alpha/v*`, install them with the `III_RELEASE_TAG` override on `install.sh`, e.g. `III_RELEASE_TAG=iii-alpha/v0.19.2-alpha.1 curl -fsSL https://iii.dev/install.sh | sh`. The worker-publish job uses the same override to pin the engine CLI.

**Tag format:** `iii-alpha/v{version}` (e.g., `iii-alpha/v0.19.2-alpha.1`)

---

### `release-iii.yml` — iii Release Pipeline

**Triggers:** tag push matching `iii/v*`

Orchestrates the full iii release across all package registries and distribution channels.

```text
setup (parse tag metadata, Slack notification)
  │
  ├─► create-iii-release (GitHub Release with auto-generated notes)
  │     │
  │     ├─► engine-release ──────► _rust-binary.yml (9 platform targets)
  │     │     │
  │     │     ├─► docker ────────► docker-engine.yml (pre-built binaries, no compilation)
  │     │     │
  │     │     └─► homebrew-engine ► _homebrew.yml (stable only)
  │     │
  │     ├─► console-frontend ───► Build React frontend for embedding
  │     │     │
  │     │     └─► console-release ► _rust-binary.yml (with embedded frontend)
  │     │           │
  │     │           └─► homebrew-console ► _homebrew.yml (stable only)
  │     │
  │     ├─► sdk-npm ─────────────► _npm.yml
  │     ├─► sdk-py ──────────────► _py.yml
  │     ├─► sdk-rust ────────────► _rust-cargo.yml
  │     └─► sdk-go ──────────────► _go.yml (pushes subdir-scoped module tag)
  │
  ├─► publish-builtin-workers ► _publish-engine-workers.yml
  └─► publish-worker-skills ► _publish-worker-skills.yml
  │
  └─► notify-complete (aggregated Slack status)
```

**Setup job** parses the tag to determine:
- `version` — stripped prefix (e.g., `iii/v1.2.3` becomes `1.2.3`)
- `is_prerelease` — true if version contains a prerelease label
- `npm_tag` — dist-tag for npm (`latest`, `alpha`, `beta`, `rc`, `dry-run`)
- `dry_run` — true if version ends with `-dry-run.N`

**Concurrency:** only one iii release runs at a time per repository.

**Skipped on dry run:** GitHub Release creation, Homebrew publish.

---

### `docker-engine.yml` — Docker Image Build & Publish

**Triggers:** called by `release-iii.yml` after engine binaries are built, or manual dispatch with a release tag

Downloads pre-built binaries from the GitHub Release (no Rust compilation) and packages them into a minimal distroless Docker image.

| Job | Runner | What it does |
|-----|--------|--------------|
| `setup` | `ubuntu-latest` | Parse version from release tag |
| `build` (amd64) | `ubuntu-latest` | Download pre-built binary, build + push image |
| `build` (arm64) | `ubuntu-24.04-arm` | Download pre-built binary, build + push image (native ARM runner) |
| `publish` | `ubuntu-latest` | Create multi-platform manifest, Trivy security scan, push to GHCR + DockerHub |

**Registries:** GHCR (`ghcr.io`) and DockerHub (`iiidev/iii`)

**Security:** Trivy vulnerability scanning (CRITICAL + HIGH), distroless nonroot runtime.

---

### `license-check.yml` — License Header Check

**Triggers:** push to `main`, pull requests to `main`

Uses [hawkeye](https://github.com/korandoru/hawkeye) to verify license headers across source files, configured via `engine/licenserc.toml`.

### `checklist-checker.yml` — License Agreement Check

**Triggers:** `pull_request_target` for pull request changes, `issue_comment` for PR comments

Requires external contributors to acknowledge the Apache 2.0 contributor license agreement before merge. Contributors can satisfy the gate by checking the license box in the PR description or by replying with the exact acknowledgement phrase posted by the bot. iii team members with `write`, `maintain`, or `admin` repository permission are skipped.

The workflow posts a sticky PR comment and publishes the `license-agreement` commit status on the PR head SHA. Branch protection should require the `license-agreement` status context.

---

## Reusable Workflows

All reusable workflows support `dry_run` mode and Slack thread notifications.

### `_npm.yml` — NPM Publish

Publishes a Node.js package to the npm registry.

| Input | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `package_path` | Directory containing the package to publish |
| `npm_tag` | dist-tag (`latest`, `alpha`, `beta`, `rc`) |
| `build_filter` | pnpm filter for building the package |
| `pre_build_filter` | pnpm filter for building dependencies first (optional) |

Uses `pnpm publish` with `--no-git-checks` and `--access public`.

### `_py.yml` — PyPI Publish

Publishes a Python package to PyPI.

Builds with `python -m build`, validates with `twine check` on dry run, publishes via `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish`.

### `_rust-cargo.yml` — Cargo Publish

Publishes a Rust crate to crates.io via `cargo publish`.

### `_go.yml` — Go Module Publish

"Publishes" a Go module by pushing a subdirectory-scoped git tag (`sdk/packages/go/iii/vX.Y.Z`) — Go has no registry, so `go get` resolves the module from the repo via the Go proxy. No token required. Dry run runs `go build/vet/test` and `go mod verify` without tagging.

### `_rust-binary.yml` — Rust Binary Release

Cross-compiles a Rust binary for 9 platform targets and uploads them to a GitHub Release.

**Targets:**

| Platform | Runner |
|----------|--------|
| `x86_64-apple-darwin` | `macos-latest` |
| `aarch64-apple-darwin` | `macos-latest` |
| `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` | `windows-latest` |
| `i686-pc-windows-msvc` | `windows-latest` |
| `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` | `windows-latest` |
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | `ubuntu-22.04` |
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` | `ubuntu-latest` |
| `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` | `ubuntu-22.04` |
| `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` | `ubuntu-22.04` |

Supports downloading a pre-built artifact (used by console to embed the frontend build).

Uses `taiki-e/upload-rust-binary-action` for building and uploading.

### `_homebrew.yml` — Homebrew Formula Publish

Generates and publishes a Homebrew formula to the `iii-hq/homebrew-tap` repository.

1. Downloads release tarballs from GitHub Releases
2. Calculates SHA256 checksums
3. Generates a Ruby formula file with platform-specific URLs
4. Tests the formula locally (`brew audit`, `brew install`, version check)
5. Commits and pushes to the tap repository

Only runs for stable (non-prerelease) versions.

### `_publish-engine-workers.yml` — Publish Builtin Engine Worker

Collects a worker's live interface from a running III engine and POSTs to `POST /publish`. Called by `release-iii.yml` for each builtin engine worker.

### `_publish-worker-skills.yml` — Publish Worker Skills

Discovers worker directories with an `iii.worker.yaml` manifest and a non-empty `skills/` tree (repo-wide, including e.g. `crates/iii-worker/src/sandbox_daemon`), builds payloads via `build_skills_payload.py`, and POSTs to `POST /w/{slug}/skills`. Called by `release-iii.yml` (after builtin worker publish) and by the manual `publish-worker-skills.yml` workflow.

| Input | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `registry_tag` | Version tag on the registry (`latest`, `next`) |
| `api_url` | Workers registry base URL |

---

### `publish-worker-skills.yml` — Manual Skills Publish

**Triggers:** `workflow_dispatch` only

Publishes skill markdown for all workers with an `iii.worker.yaml` manifest and a non-empty `skills/` tree. Choose `registry_tag` (`latest` or `next`) at dispatch time.

---

## Secrets

| Secret | Used by |
|--------|---------|

| `NPM_TOKEN` | npm registry authentication |
| `PYPI_API_TOKEN` | PyPI publishing |
| `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` | crates.io publishing |
| `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` / `DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD` | DockerHub publishing |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` / `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` | Slack release notifications |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | Slack Docker notifications |
| `WORKERS_REGISTRY_API_KEY` | Workers registry publish (`_publish-engine-workers`, `_publish-worker-skills`) |

---

## Release Flow (End to End)

1. Developer triggers `create-tag` workflow manually, selecting target/bump/prerelease
2. Workflow bumps versions across all manifests, commits, and pushes a tag
3. Tag push triggers the `release-iii` workflow
4. Release workflow fans out to reusable workflows in parallel
5. Each reusable workflow posts progress to a Slack thread
6. Final job aggregates results and updates the parent Slack message with overall status
