//! Config reload machinery.
//!
//! The types here track per-worker registrations so that when a worker is
//! destroyed (on shutdown or during reload) the engine can roll back the
//! functions / triggers it wrote into global registries. Task 1 adds only the
//! data types and the scope API on `Engine`. Later tasks wire this into
//! `FunctionsRegistry::register_function` and add the full reload pipeline.
